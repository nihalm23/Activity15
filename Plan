#Plan for activity 14
This section explains my plan for completing Activity #14 before talking about the repo itself.
For Activity #14 my plan was to reuse all of my old code from Activities 08, 10, 13, and 04 instead of writing anything new.
I first organized the QMD by making clear section headings for the Armed Forces wrangling, the baby names visualization, the box problem plot, and my reflection.
I fixed my data wrangling from Activities 08 and 10 and created the required frequency table on a smaller group of soldiers.
I added my baby names plot from Activity 13 and explained why i chose those names.
I reused my box problem function from Activity 04 and made the volume plot using ggplot like the instructions said.
I wrote a reflection section about what i feel i’ve learned in the course.
I put all of the actual code into the Code Appendix so the main body only showed results.
After everything was organized i rendered the QMD into a PDF to make sure it worked without any errors.

This section explains my plan for creating and maintaining the GitHub repo.
I created a new public repository and added the main files like the README, the Activity14.qmd file, and later the PDF.
I made a second branch so that i wouldn’t be editing the main branch directly, and i did most of my work on that branch.
I created at least two GitHub issues to track tasks i needed to finish and closed each issue when it was completed.
I used a pull request to merge my edits from my working branch back into the main branch so the repo had a clean history.
I kept the repo organized by making sure all files were named clearly and placed in the root of the project.
After everything was updated i checked that the repo contained the README, the QMD file, the PDF, the plan file, and the commit history showing the work I did.
