#Activity 15
this repository is for Activity #15 in Stat184 where I show that I can create and manage a GitHub repo.
the data for this activity comes from my Activity14 QMD file.
the current plan for the project is to keep practicing version control by making branches, issues, pull requests, and organized commits until I feel confident working with GitHub.
the repo is organized by a README file, the Activity14.qmd file, the PDF I submitted, and a plan file that explains how I created/maintained the repository.
